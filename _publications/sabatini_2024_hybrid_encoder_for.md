Quantum key distribution (QKD) is emerging as a cutting-edge application of quantum technology, gradually integrating into the industrial landscape. Many protocols employing discrete or continuous variables have been developed over time. Whereas the firsts usually excel in covering longer distances, the seconds are typically superior in producing higher secret key rates at short distances. Present efforts aim to create systems that can exploit both these strengths, foreseeing the future challenge regarding the realization of a quantum network consisting of multiple and heterogeneous interconnected nodes. Within such a context, a possible solution are devices able to efficiently toggle between discrete and continuous variable working modes with hybrid quantum state encoders. Therefore, this study presents a new hybrid encoder based on an iPOGNAC modulator, ensuring compatibility with Discrete Variable (DV) and Continuous Variable (CV) QKD systems that can be assembled entirely with commercial-off-the-shelf components. The proposed scheme is the first supporting DV polarization protocols, thus making it an appealing candidate for space nodes of a future quantum network, given that polarization-based protocols are well suited for space links.

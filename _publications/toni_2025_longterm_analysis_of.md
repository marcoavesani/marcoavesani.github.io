Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a leading technology for enabling information-theoretic secure communication, with protocols such as BB84 and its variants already deployed in practical field implementations. As QKD evolves from point-to-point links to multi-node networks, scalability and cost-effectiveness become central challenges. Among the approaches to address these issues, efficient-BB84 has shown durable and reliable performances, while optical switching techniques enable flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient integration of QKD into existing infrastructures. In this work, we present an active QKD network in a production environment, employing efficient-BB84 and optical switching, orchestrated in a coordinated manner, emphasizing their potential to support robust, future-proof quantum-secure communication systems.

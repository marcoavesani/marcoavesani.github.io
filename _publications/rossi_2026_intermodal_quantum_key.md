Intermodal quantum key distribution at telecom wavelengths provides a hybrid interface between fiber connections and free-space links, both essential for the realization of scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Although demonstrated over short-range free-space links, long-distance implementations of intermodal quantum key distribution remain challenging, due to turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations which limit efficient single-mode fiber coupling at the optical receiver. Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks.

Randomness is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, which is an invaluable resource for both classical and quantum technologies. Practical quantum random number generators (QRNG) usually need to trust their devices, but their security can be jeopardized in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work, we present a robust implementation of a Semi-Device-Independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation rates. The system works in a prepare and measure scenario where measurement and source are untrusted, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase fluctuations via post-processing, avoiding complex active phase stabilization systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an attractive solution in many practical scenarios.

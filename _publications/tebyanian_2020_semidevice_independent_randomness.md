Recently, semi-device independent protocols have attracted increasing attention, guaranteeing security with few hypotheses and experimental simplicity. In this paper, we demonstrate a many-outcomes scheme with the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) for a semi-device independent protocol based on the energy assumption. We show in theory that the number of certified random bits of the d-outcomes system outperforms the standard scheme (binary-outcomes). Furthermore, we compare the results of two well-known measurement schemes, homodyne and heterodyne detection. Lastly, taking into account the experimental imperfections, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the d-outcome design.

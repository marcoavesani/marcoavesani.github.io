Precise synchronization between transmitter and receiver is crucial for quantum communication protocols, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), to efficiently correlate the transmitted and received signals and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we introduce a synchronization technique that exploits a co-propagating classical optical communication link and test its performance in a free-space QKD system. Previously, existing techniques required additional laser beams or relied on the capability of retrieving the synchronization from the quantum signal itself, though this is not applicable in high channel loss scenarios. On the contrary, our method exploits classical and quantum signals locked to the same master clock, allowing the receiver to synchronize both the classical and quantum communication links by performing a clock-data-recovery routine on the classical signal. In this way, by exploiting the same classical communication already required for post-processing and key generation, no additional hardware is required, and the synchronization can be reconstructed from a high-power signal. Our approach is suitable for both satellite and fiber infrastructures, where a classical and quantum channel can be transmitted through the same link.

abstract = {Random numbers are commonly used in many different fields, ranging from simulations in fundamental science to security applications. In some critical cases, as Bell's tests and cryptography, the random numbers are required to be both secure (i.e. known only by the legitimate user) and to be provided at an ultra-fast rate (i.e. larger than Gbit/s). However, practical generators are usually considered trusted, but their security can be compromised in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work we introduce an efficient protocol which guarantees security and speed in the generation. We propose a novel source-device-independent protocol based on generic Positive Operator Valued Measurements and then we specialize the result to heterodyne measurements. The security of the generated numbers is proven without any assumption on the source, which can be even fully controlled by an adversary. Furthermore, we experimentally implemented the protocol by exploiting heterodyne measurements, reaching an unprecedented secure generation rate of 17.42 Gbit/s, without the need to take into account finite-size effects. Our device combines simplicity, ultrafast-rates and high security with low cost components, paving the way to new practical solutions for random number generation.},

In particular, time-bin entanglement is widely exploited to reach these purposes both in free-space and optical fiber propagation, due to the robustness and simplicity of its implementation. However, all existing realizations of time-bin entanglement suffer from an intrinsic postselection loophole, which undermines their usefulness. Here, we report the first experimental violation of Bell's inequality with "genuine" time-bin entanglement, free of the postselection loophole. We introduced a novel function of the interferometers at the two measurement stations, that operate as fast synchronized optical switches. This scheme allowed to obtain a postselection-loophole-free Bell violation of more than nine standard deviations. Since our scheme is fully implementable using standard fiber-based components and is compatible with modern integrated photonics, our results pave the way for the distribution of genuine time-bin entanglement over long distances.},

Polarization encoding has been extensively used in QKD implementations along free-space, optical fiber and satellite-based links. However, the polarization encoders used in such implementations are unstable, expensive, complex and can even exhibit side-channels that undermine the security of the implemented protocol. Here we propose a self-compensating polarization encoder based on a Lithium Niobate phase modulator inside a Sagnac interferometer and implement it using only standard telecommunication commercial off-the-shelves components (COTS). Our polarization encoder combines a simple design and high stability reaching an intrinsic quantum bit error rate as low as 0.2%. Since realization is possible from the 800 nm to the 1550 nm band by using COTS, our polarization modulator is a promising solution for free-space, fiber and satellite-based QKD.},

Here we present a polarization-based QKD system operating at 1550 nm that performs synchronization and polarization compensation by exploiting only the hardware already needed for the quantum communication task. Polarization encoding is performed by a self-compensating Sagnac loop modulator which exhibits high temporal stability and the lowest intrinsic quantum bit error rate reported so far.The QKD system was tested over a fiber-optic link, demonstrating tolerance up to about 40 dB of channel losses. Thanks to its reduced hardware requirements and the quality of the source, this work represents an important step towards technologically mature QKD systems.},

This paper presents a proof-of-principle time-bin encoding semi-DI QRNG experiments based on a prepare-and-measure scheme. The protocol requires two simple assumptions and a measurable condition: an upper-bound on the prepared pulses' energy. We lower-bound the conditional min-entropy from the energy-bound and the input-output correlation, determining the amount of genuine randomness that can be certified. Moreover, we present a generalized optimization problem for bounding the min-entropy in the case of multiple input and outcomes, in the form of a semidefinite program. The protocol is tested with a simple experimental setup, capable of realizing two configurations for the ternary time-bin encoding scheme. The experimental setup is easy-to-implement and comprises commercially available off-the-shelf components at the telecom wavelength, granting a secure and certifiable entropy source. The combination of ease-of-implementation, scalability, high security level and output-entropy, make our system a promising candidate for commercial QRNGs.},

abstract = {Quantum nonlocality offers a secure way to produce random numbers: Their unpredictability is intrinsic and can be certified just by observing the statistic of the measurement outcomes, without assumptions on how they are produced. To do this, entangled pairs are generated and measured to violate a Bell inequality with the outcome statistics. However, after a projective quantum measurement, entanglement is entirely destroyed and cannot be used again. This fact poses an upper bound to the amount of randomness that can be produced from each quantum state when projective measurements are employed. Instead, by using weak measurements, some entanglement can be maintained and reutilized, and a sequence of weak measurements can extract an unbounded amount of randomness from a single state as predicted in [Phys. Rev. A 95, 020102(R) (2017)]2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.95.020102. We study the feasibility of these weak measurements, analyze the robustness to imperfections in the quantum state they are applied to, and then test them using an optical setup based on polarization-entangled photon pairs. We show that the weak measurements are realizable, but can improve the performance of randomness generation only in close-to-ideal conditions.},

By assigning the time-related tasks to the FPGA and the management to the CPU, we built a flexible system with optimized resource sharing on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) evaluation board, which includes an SoC. Furthermore, by changing the dataflow direction, the versatile system architecture can be exploited as a QKD transmitter, QKD receiver, and QRNG control-acquiring unit. Finally, we exploited the dual-core functionality and realized a concurrent stream device to implement a practical QKD transmitter, where one core continuously receives fresh data at a sustained rate from an external QRNG source, while the other operates with the FPGA to drive the qubit transmission to the QKD receiver. The system was successfully tested on a long-term run proving its stability and security. This demonstration paves the way toward a more secure QKD implementation, with fully unconditional security as the QKD states are entirely generated by a true random process and not by deterministic expansion algorithms.

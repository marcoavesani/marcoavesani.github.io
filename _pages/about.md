I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [QuantumFuture](https://quantumfuture.dei.unipd.it/) group at University of Padova, Italy.

I am also one of the co-founders of ThinkQuantum, a spin-off company that commercializes quantum-based technology solutions for cyber security and communication systems.

Research interests
------
I'm interested in Quantum Information from both the theoretical and experimental point of view. I've been mainly working on Quantum Communication and Quantum Randomness Generation, with a particular focus on Quantum Key Distribution in fiber and free-space and Semi-Device-Independent Quantum Random Number Generators.
